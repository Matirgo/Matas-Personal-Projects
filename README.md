# Small Project Repository

This repository contains a collection of small coding projects in a variety of coding languages.
The *"projects"* are more like simple programmes that are typically contained to a single file, but may sometimes have a collection of other short files too.

Each folder should contain its own distinct README.md file to explain that programme's functionality, and potentially some of the language-specific syntax that it uses. Later projects may omit earlier descriptions.
