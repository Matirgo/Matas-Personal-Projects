# Small Project Repository

This repository contains a collection of small coding projects in a variety of coding languages.  
The *"projects"* are more like simple programmes that are typically contained to a single file, but may sometimes have a collection of other short files too.

Each folder should contain its own distinct README.md file to explain that programme's functionality, and potentially some of the language-specific syntax that it uses. Later projects may omit earlier descriptions.

## Project Levels

All projects are broken down into six ordered complexity levels. Please note that the following levels are not a direct guide, but more of a set of standards by which the various programmes may be categorised.

### Level 1 - Fundamental Programming

Level 1 projects revolve around understanding the basics of the language. This may include:  
- Variables.
- Data types.
- Basic operators.
- Writing simple scripts/functions.
  - The programme may contain control structures such as loops or conditionals, or simple data structures such as arrays, but their implementation should be straightforward.

### Level 2 - Structured Programming and Problem Solving

Building off of the fundamentals, level 2 programmes should expand their capabilities by being applied to solve a problem, rather than to just demonstrate how a specific piece of language syntax operates. Standard libraries may be implemented. This may include:  
- Defining functions to carry out different tasks.
- More sophisticated use of both control and data structures.
- Basic error handling.
  - Exceptions.
- Basic file input/output (I/O).
- Algorithmic thinking:
  - Searching.
  - Sorting.
  - Recursion.

### Level 3 - Intermediate Programming
At this level, different programming paradigms such as object-oriented programming (OOP) should be utilsed. Error handling should be more robust, testing should be introduced, as too should the use of more libraries. This may include:
- OOP.
  - Abstraction.
  - Encapsulation.
  - Polymorphism.
  - Inheritance.
- More robust error handling.
  - Exceptions.
  - Runtime errors.
- Unit testing.
- More advanced data structures and algorithms.
  - Trees.
  - Graphs.
- More sophisticated file I/O.
- Use of libraries.

### Level 4 - Systems and Advanced Programming
These programmes mostly focus on optimising algorithms, using application programming interfaces (APIs) to extend functionality, and make use of more professional grade practices to deliver more robust tools. This may include:
- Memory management.
- Code efficiency.
  - Considering Big-O for space and time complexity.
- Use of APIs.
- More sophisticated testing paradigms.
  - Test-driven development (TDD).

### Level 5 - Domain Expertise Programming
The final level is not necessarily harder or more complicated than the previous levels, but rather is very specific about a domain niche. This is commonly seen in maching learning, and in software development through the use of specific tools. This may include:
- Machine learning.
- Framework-specific expertise.
  - Flask.
  - Rails.
  - React.
